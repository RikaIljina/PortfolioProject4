                <hr>
                <p>Welcome to MusicLab, a place where artists can share their creations, give and receive
                    constructive feedback, and explore fresh avenues of collaboration.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3>
                    What will you find here?
                </h3>

                <p>We provide a space for musicians of each and every skill level and all genres – from pop ballad and
                    classic rock to experimental House and Klingon opera.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3>What can you share?</h3>

                <p>As long as it consists of soundwaves you’ve created with our own mouth, hands, gills, etc. you are
                    welcome to share it. Covers are allowed if tagged accordingly. While not mandatory, other users will
                    also welcome it if you tag NSFW entries and other possible triggering content.</p>

                <p>If you want to document a work in progress, check <i>"Keep file"</i> when editing an entry and
                    uploading a
                    new
                    version - the old file will not be deleted.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3>How to interact with other creators?</h3>

                <p>We encourage users to like and comment on entries and get in touch with each other via the contact
                    info
                    provided.</p>

                <p>When commenting on other people’s works, please remember to be open-minded and constructive. MusicLab
                    reserves the right to delete comments or block users who use abusive and discriminatory language or
                    troll others.</p>

                <p>Please also refrain from advertising your own music in the comments section of other creators.</p>
